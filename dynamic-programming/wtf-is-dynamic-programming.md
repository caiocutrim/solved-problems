# WTF is dynamic programming?
"A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler
subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions"


- Only works with:
  - Overlapping subproblems
  ex: Fibo recursive solution
  - Optimal substructure
  ex: shortest-path (graph's algorithm)

- Memoization
