# What this repo is? 
 
 Some common algorithms solutions and data-structures implementations for interview challenges

# Who cares about it?

Great company like Google, etc... has tested programmers with main concepts of computer science.

I'm incouraged to put somethings here that I have learned and I'm thinking to implement when necessary.

I choose javascript language, because it is fun. There is no another reason.

I am trying to push skills set to the next level.

# It's under construction

If you have some idea to improve this bucket of code, please, contact me here on github.

Cheers!
